This architecture will not only assess the task context and expert performance but will also learn from previous interactions by evaluating the quality of answers given and incorporating that feedback into future expert selections.  \n**Overall Idea:**  \nThe architecture will employ a holistic scoring system that evaluates both the performance of experts and the context of the tasks they are assigned. By integrating a learning mechanism that adjusts expert scores based on historical success rates and relevance of answers, the system can dynamically adapt expert selection to improve accuracy over time.  \n**Implementation:**  \n1. Define a scoring system that tracks each expert's performance based on both success and response quality over time.  \n2. Analyze the task context and use that analysis to adjust expert scores dynamically.  \n3. Engage not just the expert with the highest score but filter for contextually relevant answers, fostering more nuanced decision-making.  \n4. Log expert performance based on the relevance and comprehensiveness of answers, facilitating effective learning from past interactions.",
