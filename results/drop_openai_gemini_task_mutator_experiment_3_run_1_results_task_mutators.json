    "task_mutators": [
        "Transform the given problem into a narrative: Write a short story that encapsulates the essence of the problem while offering a unique perspective.",
        "Encourage visualization: Instead of solving the problem directly, prompt the user to create a mind map or diagram that illustrates the relationships and components of the problem.",
        "Incorporate role play: Suggest that the user assume the role of a character who faces this problem and explore potential solutions from that character's perspective.",
        "Infuse creativity: Challenge the user to reimagine the problem in a different context or setting, such as a fantasy world or futuristic scenario, and propose solutions based on that new environment.",
        "Foster collaboration: Invite the user to share their problem with a peer or group, encouraging discussion and brainstorming of diverse solutions together.",
        "Apply a metaphor: Ask the user to express the problem through a metaphor or analogy, exploring how this new comparison could illuminate different facets of the issue.",
        "Utilize the inversion technique: Encourage the user to think about the opposite of the problem, asking them how they would create the worst possible scenario and what that reveals about the original issue.",
        "Suggest iterative refinement: Instead of solving the problem in one go, prompt the user to draft an initial solution, then refine it through several iterations, seeking feedback at each stage.",
        "Incorporate sensory exploration: Ask the user to describe the problem using sensory details (sight, sound, touch, etc.), which may lead to new insights and creative solutions.",
        "Encourage philosophical inquiry: Prompt the user to reflect on the underlying principles and values related to the problem, exploring how these can shape innovative approaches to resolution."
