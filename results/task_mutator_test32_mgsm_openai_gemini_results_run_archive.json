This architecture allows agents to not only provide critiques but also to engage in a dialogue where they ask targeted questions based on each other's responses. The focus will be on refining understanding through collaborative inquiry, leading to a more nuanced and accurate final answer.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will consist of an initial answering phase, followed by a continuous critique and inquiry phase where agents actively engage in discussions. Agents will assume roles based on their strengths during the inquiry phase, dynamically adapting to create a more effective collaborative process.",

This architecture will maintain the iterative critique and inquiry process while incorporating structured role assignment based on the ongoing dialogue. Each agent will not only engage in providing initial answers and critiques but will also adapt their roles dynamically during discussions. This change aims to improve the quality of interactions and ensure that the most suitable expertise is applied during the inquiry phase for better problem resolution.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will consist of initial answering, critique, and inquiry phases, followed by a role adaptation phase where agents modify their roles based on the discussions and the critiques received.
