This innovative approach will allow agents to not only provide answers but engage in meaningful dialogue, refining their perspectives through active participation.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of a group of agents that engage in a circular questioning and answering process, allowing each agent to respond and then pose questions to others based on their responses. This back-and-forth interaction will improve understanding and result in a more robust final answer.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize a diverse set of agents (e.g., Math Professor, Grade School Teacher, Math Enthusiast).\n2. Each agent will present its initial answer followed by a round of questions where they can ask clarifying questions to any of the other agents based on their responses.\n3. After a predefined number of rounds, collect the refined answers from each agent and synthesize them into a final response using another dedicated agent.",
