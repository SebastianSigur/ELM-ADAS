        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the current architecture further, I propose an architecture that focuses on systematic feedback integration while generating answers. Instead of treating feedback as a separate process, the architecture will involve generating an initial answer and then using feedback to refine that answer iteratively, ensuring that this process remains efficient in terms of API usage.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will use a single LLM query to generate an answer and then iteratively refine that answer based on feedback from a critic agent. This iterative process will enhance the quality of the output while staying within the API call limits.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Generate an initial answer with a clear instruction set that includes both solving the problem and explaining the reasoning.\n2. Use a feedback mechanism to evaluate the initial answer and refine it based on critiques.\n3. Maintain a loop for refining the answer based on feedback while ensuring that the total number of API calls remains below the defined limit.",
