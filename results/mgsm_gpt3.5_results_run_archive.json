        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the architecture, I propose a novel approach that focuses on integrating a scoring mechanism for evaluating the feedback provided by critique agents. By adopting a weighted evaluation system, we can ensure that feedback is not only collected but also assessed based on its quality and relevance. Additionally, instead of relying solely on common feedback, we will synthesize the feedback from multiple perspectives to derive a more robust final answer. This approach combines the strengths of diverse insights with a structured feedback evaluation, optimizing both accuracy and resource efficiency.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe updated architecture will utilize a Chain-of-Thought agent to generate an initial answer. Following this, multiple critique agents will evaluate the answer from different perspectives, scoring their feedback based on clarity, correctness, and completeness. The feedback will be synthesized into a final answer by selecting the highest-scoring candidates, ensuring the final output is comprehensive and reliable. This architecture provides a more dynamic and innovative solution compared to previous designs, building upon the insights from prior efforts while incorporating an effective evaluation component.",
