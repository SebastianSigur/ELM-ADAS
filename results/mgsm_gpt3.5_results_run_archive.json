This feedback-driven approach is intended to bolster the quality of the final output, ensuring it is well-reasoned and coherent.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define clear instructions that guide the LLM to generate diverse solutions and evaluate them immediately.\n2. Use a single LLMAgentBase instance to facilitate both generation and evaluation to reduce the total number of API calls.\n3. Implement a process where the feedback from evaluations is used to refine the generated answers before synthesizing them into a final coherent response.",
