        "thought": "**Insights:** The previous architecture did not leverage the feedback process effectively, leading to a lack of meaningful adjustments. A more structured mechanism for interpreting feedback will enhance agent collaboration and effectiveness.\n\n**Overall Idea:** The new architecture will enhance collaborative learning by implementing a systematic feedback interpretation process. Each agent will not only generate outputs but also reflect on the feedback received and discuss potential improvements collaboratively. This will encourage agents to learn from each other and refine their outputs based on peer insights.\n\n**Implementation:** 1. **Initialize Agents:** Each agent generates its output based on the task input. \n2. **Structured Feedback Interpretation:** Agents will categorize feedback into actionable items (e.g., correctness, efficiency, or specific coding issues) and discuss these items with one another. Each agent will propose changes based on peer feedback.\n3. **Collaborative Adjustment:** Agents will adjust their outputs based on discussed feedback rather than blindly applying changes, ensuring the adjustments are meaningful.\n4. **Final Decision Making:** Collect refined outputs and make a final decision based on the best adjustments derived from peer collaboration.",
