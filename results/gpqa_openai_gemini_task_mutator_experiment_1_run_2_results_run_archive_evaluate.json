This design focuses on refining the evaluation and integration of critiques by dynamically adjusting the integration process based on real-time performance metrics of the agents. The emphasis will be on contextual understanding and the significance of each critique, allowing for a more nuanced integration that incorporates diverse perspectives without compromising on quality.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of specialized agents for generating answers, followed by critique agents that assess these answers based on adaptive scoring systems. Each critique will be evaluated in context, allowing the architecture to prioritize critiques that offer the most valuable insights for integration. This approach facilitates a more granular understanding of the contributions made by each agent, leading to superior final responses.",
