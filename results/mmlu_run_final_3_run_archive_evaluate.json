This will ensure clear and focused feedback, which can then be aggregated to refine the primary answer effectively.\n\n**Overall Idea:** This architecture will consist of a primary reasoning agent providing an initial answer, with critique agents evaluating this answer independently. Each critique agent will assess the answer based on clarity, correctness, and completeness, and this feedback will be aggregated to guide the primary reasoning agent in refining its answer. The system focuses on enhancing feedback quality while maintaining simplicity.\n\n**Implementation:** The implementation will involve defining the primary reasoning agent, creating critique agents that provide independent feedback, and establishing a clear scoring mechanism for evaluating the quality of this feedback. The feedback will be collected efficiently, and the primary agent will refine its answer based on the best critique received.",
