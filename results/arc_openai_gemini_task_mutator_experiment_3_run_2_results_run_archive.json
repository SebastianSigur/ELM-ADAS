        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe revised architecture will aim to optimize the process of generating and refining transformation codes by utilizing a robust similarity scoring mechanism, allowing for more effective learning from previous transformations. The architecture will focus on allowing agents to collaboratively refine their approaches based on both individual and shared learning experiences.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will consist of a single agent that generates transformation codes based on input grids, evaluates performance through a sophisticated similarity measure, and iteratively refines the transformation logic based on detailed error analysis and shared insights from multiple agents. This enhanced collaborative approach will ensure the agent can adaptively learn from past transformations while effectively managing discrepancies in outputs.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Generate initial transformation code based on previous examples.\n2. Evaluate the generated code against expected outputs.\n3. Implement a detailed similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity) for retrieving transformation strategies from dynamic memory.\n4. Filter unique adjustments based on discrepancies identified.\n5. Use a refined transformation logic to generate outputs for test inputs.",
