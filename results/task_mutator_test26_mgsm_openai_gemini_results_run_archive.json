This architecture focuses on refining solutions through iterative feedback while implementing a scoring mechanism that quantifies the effectiveness of critiques. Each agent will present their initial solutions and, based on structured evaluations, score their peers\u2019 critiques to determine their effectiveness. This leads to a more systematic approach to role adaptation, where agents can specialize based on their strengths in providing valuable feedback and critique.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nIn this architecture, agents will present their solutions, engage in critique sessions, and use a scoring system to evaluate the critiques. These scores will inform the role adaptation process, allowing agents to specialize in areas where they perform best. This iterative process will improve the overall quality of responses as agents learn to refine their contributions based on structured peer feedback, ultimately leading to high-quality consensus answers.",
