The emphasis on structured feedback and role adaptation is common and does not significantly push the boundaries of LLM architectures. Therefore, I propose a shift towards a framework that emphasizes **Collaborative Adaptive Reasoning**, where agents dynamically not only adapt their roles but also engage in proactive discussions to refine their answers based on real-time feedback from peers.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nIn this architecture, agents will engage in a discussion phase where they can ask clarifying questions about each other's responses. This interaction will be driven by their assessments of the task and each other's reasoning, allowing them to refine their contributions collaboratively. The agents will dynamically adjust their roles based on the complexity of the task and the feedback they receive from their peers. This collaborative approach aims to enhance both the quality of the answers and the learning experience of each agent.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initialize Multiple Agents:** Set up a diverse pool of agents capable of specializing based on task complexity.\n2. **Generate Initial Answers:** Each agent will independently provide an answer.\n3. **Collaborative Discussion Loop:** Instead of just providing feedback, agents will interactively discuss their answers, posing questions and clarifications.\n4. **Dynamic Role Evaluation:** Agents will reflect on their performance during the discussion and adapt their roles based on the complexity of the task and the feedback received.\n5. **Consensus Mechanism:** Finally, aggregate the refined answers to determine the best response based on collaborative insights.",

This architecture focuses on enabling agents to adapt their reasoning styles dynamically based on the complexity of the task and the feedback they receive. This approach allows agents to engage more interactively, exploring different reasoning strategies while iteratively refining their answers based on peer insights and task demands.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe idea is to establish an interactive feedback mechanism that not only allows agents to assess their contributions but also encourages them to adapt their reasoning styles based on contextual clues from the task and peer evaluations. Agents will generate initial responses and participate in discussions to reflect on their approaches, enabling them to shift their reasoning styles as needed to improve performance.\n\n**Implementation:**\nThe implementation will follow these steps:\n1. **Initialize Multiple Agents:** Set up a diverse group of agents, each specializing in different reasoning strategies (e.g., strategy-focused agents).\n2. **Generate Initial Answers:** Each agent independently generates an answer based on the task and documents their reasoning.\n3. **Dynamic Role Reflection Phase:** After generating their responses, agents will participate in a discussion assessing their performance and the performance of their peers, focusing on adapting their reasoning styles based on feedback.\n4. **Feedback and Adaptation:** Based on the discussion, agents will provide feedback on their peers\u2019 reasoning and suggest adaptations to their styles based on observed strengths and weaknesses.\n5. **Revise Responses:** Agents will revise their answers based on the integrated feedback and explain how this process influenced their reasoning.\n6. **Final Evaluation Mechanism:** Implement a scoring system that evaluates each agent's revised response, ensuring that the best response is selected based on the collaborative insights gathered during discussions.",
