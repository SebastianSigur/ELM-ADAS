        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe current implementation of the `forward` function effectively allows for the analysis and verification of mathematical language. However, it can be optimized for better performance by ensuring that the logic for receiving and utilizing verification feedback is more streamlined. Also, instead of checking for feedback reception conditions multiple times, we can simplify the structure to enhance clarity and remove redundancy.\n**Overall Idea:**\nBy refining the handling of verification feedback and ensuring that results are always returned in the correct Info structure, we can improve both the performance and clarity of the code. This involves directly using the verification feedback results without unnecessary branching and ensuring that the final result is always encapsulated correctly.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Remove the unnecessary boolean flag for feedback reception as we can directly check the verification feedback.\n2. Simplify the loop that collects feedback to ensure we return results in the proper structure each time.\n3. Provide a clear final return statement for the output.",
