        "Transform the existing problem into a real-world scenario. For example, if the problem involves abstract numbers, relate it to a practical situation like budgeting or resource allocation.",
        "Encourage the user to visualize the problem using diagrams or graphs. Suggest they sketch out the concepts to better understand the relationships involved.",
        "Challenge the user to find multiple solutions or approaches to the problem. Instead of seeking a single answer, prompt them to explore various methods or strategies to arrive at different conclusions.",
        "Introduce an element of creativity by asking the user to create a story or narrative around the problem. This could involve personifying numbers or concepts to make the problem more relatable and engaging.",
        "Suggest the user to collaborate with peers to tackle the problem. Encourage them to discuss their thought processes and approaches, promoting a collective problem-solving mindset.",
        "Inspire the user to rethink the parameters of the problem. Ask them to consider what would happen if certain constraints were removed or altered, fostering innovative thinking.",
        "Encourage the user to apply a different mathematical concept or theorem to the problem. Prompt them to think about how they could leverage other areas of mathematics to gain new insights.",
        "Guide the user to reflect on a similar problem they have solved in the past. Ask them to draw parallels and utilize lessons learned from previous experiences to inform their current approach.",
        "Ask the user to articulate their thought process as they work through the problem. Promoting metacognition can help them identify gaps in their understanding and clarify their reasoning.",
        "Invite the user to gamify the problem. Encourage them to treat the problem like a puzzle or challenge, where they can earn points for each step solved or explore different levels of complexity."
