This collaborative framework will not only gather feedback but will also refine answers iteratively based on critique discussions.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Define distinct roles for critique agents.** Each role will have a unique perspective, such as focusing on logical reasoning, numerical accuracy, or contextual understanding.\n2. **Integrate structured critique gathering.** Create a function that organizes feedback to facilitate more efficient processing.\n3. **Enable iterative feedback application.** Allow agents to adjust their responses based on the critiques received, iterating through the discussion until consensus is reached or adequate refinement achieved.",
