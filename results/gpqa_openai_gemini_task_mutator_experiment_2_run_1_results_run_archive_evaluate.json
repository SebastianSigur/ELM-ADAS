This architecture will not only rely on structured critique but will actively involve agents in a consensus-building process where they collaboratively refine their answers based on collective insights. This collaborative refinement will ensure that agents learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, leading to higher-quality responses overall.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of specialized agents generating initial answers followed by a consensus phase where they collaboratively critique and refine each other's responses. This will be done through an iterative process where feedback is not just collected but utilized actively to build a refined consensus answer.\n**Implementation:**\nThe architecture will consist of specialized agents generating initial answers followed by a consensus phase where they collaboratively critique and refine each other's responses.
