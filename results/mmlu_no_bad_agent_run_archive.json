This model will encourage continuous refinement of the initial answer with a more adaptive approach to generating alternatives.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe revised architecture will consist of an initial reasoning agent to generate a response, followed by a critique agent that evaluates the answer. Instead of separate rounds of alternatives, the architecture will allow for direct adjustments to the initial answer based on critique feedback, followed by a single generation of alternatives that specifically address identified shortcomings. This will create a more efficient cycle of improvements leading to a final synthesized answer.\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initial Reasoning:** Start with a reasoning agent to generate an initial answer.\n2. **Single Critique:** Deploy a critique agent that evaluates the answer and provides specific feedback.\n3. **Direct Refinement:** Use the critique feedback to refine the initial answer immediately before generating alternatives.\n4. **Final Alternatives:** Generate a single set of alternatives that address the critiques directly.\n5. **Synthesis:** Compile the refined answer and alternatives into a coherent final response.",
