        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe current architecture could benefit from a more dynamic approach to feedback and evaluation. Instead of just gathering critiques, agents should actively learn and adapt based on their interactions, similar to how humans refine their thought processes through social interactions. The proposed architecture will integrate a mechanism for agents to not only critique but also build upon each other's strengths, creating a more interactive and adaptive learning environment.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will implement a collaborative learning environment where agents not only critique but also contribute enhancements to each other's initial responses. This will allow for a more fluid exchange of ideas and knowledge, ultimately leading to a more refined final answer. By emphasizing collaboration and adaptation, the architecture aims to foster a more robust reasoning capability among agents.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Collaborative Learning Mechanism:** Each agent will be tasked with not only critiquing responses but also suggesting improvements or alternative solutions based on their understanding.\n2. **Dynamic Feedback Loop:** After each round of critiques, agents will integrate the feedback into their reasoning to produce a more refined response in subsequent iterations.\n3. **Final Decision Process:** The final output will weigh contributions based on the depth and relevance of critiques, allowing the most credible responses to inform the final answer.\n4. **Reduction of Redundancies:** The architecture will minimize repetitive steps by ensuring critiques are actionable and relevant to the task at hand.",
