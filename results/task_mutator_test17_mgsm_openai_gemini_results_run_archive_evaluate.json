The architecture will focus on generating an initial answer using a contextual Chain-of-Thought agent, while also incorporating a panel of experts who engage in an iterative feedback loop. This architecture will leverage the contextual insights gained from the initial problem analysis to guide subsequent critiques and refinements, leading to more contextually relevant solutions.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe proposed architecture will consist of a Chain-of-Thought agent that first generates an answer after analyzing the context of the problem. A panel of expert critics will then review and critique the answer in multiple rounds, ensuring the critiques are weighted based on their relevance and expertise, ultimately refining the solution based on collaborative insights.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Analyze the task for contextual understanding before generating the initial answer.\n2. Use a Chain-of-Thought agent to generate an initial answer based on the context.\n3. Create a panel of expert critics to provide feedback, ensuring critique weight is determined by the expert's relevance to the task.\n4. Conduct iterative feedback and refine insights based on critiques, focusing on improving the answer and validating it against the task context.\n5.
