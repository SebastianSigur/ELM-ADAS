This visualization-driven method can enhance understanding and clarity in problem-solving. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will incorporate a visual reasoning agent that creates diagrams or visual representations of the mathematical problem, allowing the LLM to engage with the problem from a different perspective. The visual representation will then be analyzed to extract mathematical principles, followed by the problem-solving phase. This method may also help in breaking down complex problems into simpler visual components.\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Visual Representation Generation:** Create an agent dedicated to generating visual representations of the mathematical problem.\n2. **Principle Extraction:** Develop an agent that analyzes the visual output to derive mathematical principles.\n3. **Problem Solving:** Finally, implement an agent to solve the problem using the insights gained from the visual representation.",
