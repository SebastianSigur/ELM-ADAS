        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo create a more innovative architecture, I propose an 'Interactive Feedback Loop' architecture that emphasizes real-time user engagement and iterative improvement. This architecture will utilize a continuous feedback mechanism where user input directly influences each agent's approach throughout the task-solving process. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe 'Interactive Feedback Loop' architecture aims to create a system where multiple agents specialize in different aspects of the problem. Each agent will generate a solution, and as users provide feedback, the agents will refine their approaches iteratively. This architecture prioritizes user engagement and ensures that final solutions are fine-tuned based on user preferences and insights. \n**Implementation:**\n1. **Real-time User Feedback:** Implement a mechanism for collecting user input continuously during the problem-solving process. \n2. **Agent Adaptation:** Allow agents to adjust their strategies based on real-time feedback, ensuring a responsive system. \n3. **Critique and Score:** Establish a scoring system for critiques, integrating user feedback to determine the effectiveness of each agent's contribution. \n4. **Synthesis with User Insight:** Use the compiled critiques and user input to create a final answer that reflects both the agents' strengths and the user's needs.",
