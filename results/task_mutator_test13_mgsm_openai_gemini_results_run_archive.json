        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe previous 'Dynamic Debate Framework' lacked sufficient differentiation from existing frameworks. To enhance the architecture, I propose a 'Dynamic Debate Framework' that emphasizes not only presenting solutions but also adaptive interactions between agents based on the quality of their arguments. This architecture will utilize a scoring system for critiques, enabling agents to weigh responses and improve their solutions iteratively. The approach encourages a more nuanced debate that considers the strength of the arguments rather than treating all critiques as equal.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe framework will consist of specialized agents for different mathematical domains that will engage in structured debates. Each agent will initially present its solution and then critique others while scoring the critiques based on predefined criteria. This scoring will guide the agents in refining their answers in subsequent iterations, ensuring that the most robust arguments prevail. A synthesis agent will then consolidate these refined solutions into a coherent final answer.",
