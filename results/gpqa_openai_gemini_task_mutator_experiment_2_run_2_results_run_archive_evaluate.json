This will enable the agent to make more informed adjustments to the answers based on detailed feedback rather than a binary approach. Additionally, I will streamline the critique process to allow for integrated adjustments based on multiple critiques, improving overall response accuracy.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Maintain classification to determine relevant expert agents.\n2. Implement a detailed scoring mechanism for critiques that differentiates between types of feedback.\n3. Refactor how critiques are collected and applied to each answer, allowing for a more integrated adjustment process.\n4.
