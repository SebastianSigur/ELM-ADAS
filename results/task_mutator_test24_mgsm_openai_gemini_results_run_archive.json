After feedback, roles will switch, allowing both agents to enhance their perspectives iteratively.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define roles for agents as 'Provider' and 'Critic'.\n2. Each agent takes turns presenting their initial thoughts and providing structured feedback.\n3. Implement a loop that allows agents to refine their thoughts after receiving feedback.\n4. Conclude with a final synthesis to integrate insights from both agents, enhancing the overall quality of the solution.",
