This architecture will focus on the collaborative aspects of problem-solving while incorporating a robust feedback loop that enhances learning.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will feature specialized agents who provide not only their answers but also detailed evaluations of peers' responses based on defined criteria. The final decision-making process will aggregate these evaluations to reach a consensus, allowing agents to refine their reasoning continually.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. **Initialize Specialized Agents:** Each agent specializes in a mathematical domain and provides explicit evaluation criteria.\n2. **Collective Reasoning:** Agents independently solve the task and present their answers and evaluations of others.\n3. **Structured Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a clear system for agents to assess peers based on clarity, correctness, and thoroughness.\n4. **Final Decision:** An aggregate scoring system will weigh the feedback and contributions from each agent to derive a final answer, ensuring that the best reasoning is prioritized.",
