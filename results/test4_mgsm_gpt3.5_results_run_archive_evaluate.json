        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the collaborative nature of the discussions among agents, I propose an architecture that focuses on dynamic interaction based on both evaluations and content clarification. This architecture will improve the question-asking mechanism, allowing agents not only to critique their answers but also to probe deeper into the logic and reasoning of their peers' responses. This dynamic questioning can lead to richer discussions and refinements, drawing a clear distinction from previous architectures.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe design will consist of agents generating initial answers followed by a two-step process: first, they will evaluate their own answers and then dynamically ask clarifying questions to other agents based on both the evaluations and the content of the answers. This will create a more interactive environment that fosters deeper understanding and collaborative refinement of answers. Finally, a consensus agent will be responsible for aggregating these refined responses into a final answer, while considering the quality of discussions and critiques.",
