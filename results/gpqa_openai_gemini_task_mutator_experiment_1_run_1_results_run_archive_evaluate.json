Instead of merely aggregating answers, I propose a structure that allows for a preliminary discussion phase among experts who can critique and refine each other's answers before a final consensus is reached. This collaborative refinement could lead to a more accurate and thorough understanding of the task.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe proposed architecture, named 'Collaborative Expert Refinement,' will allow experts to first share their initial answers, followed by a critical discussion where they can adjust their responses based on each other's insights.
