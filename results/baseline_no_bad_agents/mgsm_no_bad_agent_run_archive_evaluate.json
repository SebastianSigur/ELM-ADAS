        "thought": "**Insights:** The revised architecture will maintain the classification approach but will enhance the method of agent specialization by including a consensus mechanism among specialized agents. This will enable the system to address problems where agents may arrive at different conclusions, ensuring a more robust final answer. \n**Overall Idea:** This architecture will classify a problem and route it to specialized agents, employing a voting mechanism to reconcile differences in their answers. This will help improve accuracy and reliability in problem-solving. \n**Implementation:** 1) Classify the problem to determine its category. 2) Use specialized agents to solve the problem. 3) If there's disagreement among agents, implement a voting mechanism to determine the final answer. 4) Incorporate a fallback mechanism for unresolved issues.",
