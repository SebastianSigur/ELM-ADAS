        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo further enhance the collaborative learning aspect and utilize feedback more effectively, I propose an architecture that incorporates a scoring mechanism for feedback relevance. This will allow the agents to not only learn from their experiences but also from the quality of feedback provided by peers. The new architecture will employ a dynamic adjustment system that modifies agent behavior based on the feedback score, ensuring that only constructive insights lead to significant changes in their reasoning processes. By prioritizing higher-quality feedback, the agents will become more adept at refining their reasoning styles over time.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture introduces a performance scoring system for feedback provided between agents. Each agent will evaluate the constructiveness of the feedback it receives and apply a dynamic adjustment to its reasoning strategy based on accumulated scores. This will create a more nuanced and effective learning environment where agent interactions are optimized for continuous improvement.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initialize Agents with Feedback Scoring:** Create pairs of LLM agents, each specialized in different reasoning styles.\n2. **Feedback Scoring Mechanism:** After each interaction, implement a scoring system that evaluates feedback based on clarity, relevance, and constructiveness.\n3. **Dynamic Adjustment of Responses:** Utilize the feedback scores to adjust agents' reasoning strategies in subsequent tasks dynamically.\n4. **Iterative Learning:** Enable the agents to store feedback scores over time, refining their responses based on the collective learning experience.\n5. **Final Decision Making:** Use the insights gained from peer interactions, combined with the scoring system, to generate a final answer with improved accuracy.",
