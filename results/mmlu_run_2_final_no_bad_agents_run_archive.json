        "thought": "**Insights:** A more adaptive framework incorporating dynamic learning from peer critiques can improve the negotiation process in answer generation. By developing a system that evaluates the relevance and quality of critiques, the architecture can better refine its answers based on the most constructive feedback.\n**Overall Idea:** The proposed architecture, 'Adaptive Learning Negotiation System', will focus on generating initial answers while incorporating a scoring mechanism for critiques that allows the system to weigh feedback effectively. This way, the architecture can adapt its reasoning process and improve accuracy over multiple iterations without becoming overly complex.\n**Implementation:** 1. Implement initial answer generation as before. 2. Introduce a scoring mechanism for critiques that evaluates their relevance. 3. Adapt the generation of answers based on the weighted critiques. 4. Final aggregation that weighs the critiques effectively in determining the best answer.",
