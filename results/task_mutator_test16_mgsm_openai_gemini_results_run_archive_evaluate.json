The revised architecture will emphasize actionable insights from the Mentor while guiding the Students towards self-reflection on their reasoning. This approach will create a deeper learning experience and improve the overall effectiveness of the system.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe refined architecture will maintain the mentor-student paradigm but will introduce structured feedback mechanisms that explicitly outline strengths and weaknesses in the students\u2019 reasoning. Additionally, confidence-based voting will be incorporated to select the final answer based on both frequency and the perceived quality of answers.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize a Mentor Agent that not only provides insights but also reviews student answers with a focus on logical reasoning and clarity.\n2. Allow Student Agents to reflect on both their reasoning and the Mentor\u2019s feedback, fostering self-assessment.\n3. Utilize confidence scores when aggregating answers, allowing for more nuanced decision-making in the final answer selection.\n4.
