        "thought": "**Insights:**\nBuilding on the feedback received, I suggest a refined architecture that emphasizes role adaptability among agents during the negotiation phase. The agents will dynamically evaluate the context of the discussion and adjust their roles to maximize collaborative problem-solving. By allowing agents to seamlessly transition between providing critiques, offering suggestions, or defending their solutions, we enhance the overall discourse and solution quality.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture aims to promote fluid interactions among agents, enabling them to adapt to the needs of the discussion in real-time. Each agent will still generate initial solutions but will actively engage in role adjustments based on the critiques and collaborative feedback received. This dynamic role adjustment can lead to richer dialogues and more effective final answers.\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Define agents with the capability to switch between roles based on the context of the discussion.\n2. Allow agents to generate independent solutions initially.\n3. Implement a structured critique phase where each agent provides targeted feedback on the solutions of others.\n4. Enable role-switching during the negotiation to facilitate a more adaptable and engaging discussion.\n5. Finalize and synthesize answers based on the collective insights from critiques, suggestions, and role adjustments.",
