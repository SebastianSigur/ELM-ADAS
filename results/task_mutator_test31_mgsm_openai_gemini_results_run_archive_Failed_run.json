Each agent will attempt to solve the task independently, critique each other's solutions, engage in a debate to defend or argue against critiques, and then reach a consensus based on the results of the debates.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize agents for various roles (Mathematician, Teacher, Student).\n2. Collect initial answers from each agent based on their roles.\n3. In the critique phase, agents will evaluate each other's responses with structured feedback, including positive and negative aspects.\n4. In the debate phase, agents will defend their critiques and present counterarguments to each other.\n5. Implement a consensus mechanism to derive a final answer based on the debates and critiques, weighing contributions from agents accordingly.\n6.
