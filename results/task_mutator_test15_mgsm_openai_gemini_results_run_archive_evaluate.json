        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo advance the 'Community of Experts' concept, I propose an architecture where critiques are not only collected but also systematically scored based on their relevance and expertise, allowing for a more informed synthesis of the final answer. Furthermore, the architecture will feature an enhanced routing mechanism that dynamically adapts expert selection based on a deeper analysis of the task complexity.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe revised architecture, 'Expert Critique and Synthesis', will consist of multiple expert agents that generate initial solutions, followed by a structured critique phase where the critiques are scored. This scoring will inform the final synthesis, allowing the model to weigh critiques by their relevance and the expertise of the critiquing agent. The routing mechanism will be improved to ensure that the most suitable expert is consulted based on a comprehensive understanding of the task.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initialize Agents:** Create a list of expert agents with distinct roles and implement a routing agent that selects the most suitable expert based on the task context.\n2. **Generate Initial Responses:** Each expert will independently solve the provided task and generate initial responses.\n3. **Critique Phase:** After all agents provide their answers, each agent will critique the others' responses, and these critiques will be scored based on relevance.\n4. **Synthesize Final Answer:** A final decision agent will aggregate the critiques and initial answers, using the weighted critiques to refine the overall response.\n5. **Return Output:** The architecture will return the final synthesized answer, reflecting a consensus that incorporates expert critiques.",
