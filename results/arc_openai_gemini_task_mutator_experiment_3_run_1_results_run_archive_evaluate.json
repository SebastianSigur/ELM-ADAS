This architecture will prioritize integrating insights from multiple agents to develop a comprehensive solution rather than just adopting one agent's output based on correctness.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) agents that generate solutions and reasoning. After evaluating each other's outputs, they will collaboratively synthesize a final solution based on their insights. This way, the agents contribute to a final output that reflects a collective understanding of the transformation rules.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize multiple CoT agents to generate solutions and provide reasoning.\n2. Each agent evaluates their solution and others\u2019 solutions, focusing on both correctness and the quality of reasoning.\n3. Instead of modifying solutions directly, agents will compile insights based on the evaluations.\n4.
