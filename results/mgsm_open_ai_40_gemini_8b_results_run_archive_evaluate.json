This new approach will emphasize more critical analysis of each agent's contributions, allowing for a more robust reflective process.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nI propose an architecture that incorporates a **Dynamic Role Allocation and Critique Evaluation** system. In this architecture, agents will dynamically assign themselves roles based on their strengths and the task requirements. After performing an initial reasoning, agents will engage in discussions where they critique each other\u2019s outputs, followed by a reflection that evaluates the critiques based on their relevance and utility before synthesizing a final answer.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Dynamic Role Assignment:** Agents will determine roles based on initial assessments of the task complexity and their capabilities.\n2. **Structured Discussion Phase:** Agents will critique one another's answers, focusing on actionable suggestions and improvements.\n3. **Reflective Evaluation:** After critiques, agents will assess the validity of feedback before refining their answers.\n4. **Enhanced Synthesis:** The final answer will be synthesized considering the quality of critiques and the original outputs.",
