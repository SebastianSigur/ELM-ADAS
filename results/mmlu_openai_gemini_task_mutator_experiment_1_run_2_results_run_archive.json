Each agent will initially generate an answer but will also have the opportunity to critique peers based on their prior submissions. This approach fosters a more fluid collaboration, allowing agents to leverage their strengths effectively while fostering continuous improvement in the quality of the responses. Additionally, a meta-evaluator will synthesize both answers and critiques to deliver the best final response.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of domain-specific agents (STEM, Humanities, Social Sciences) that both generate responses and critique their peers. A dynamic role assignment system will assess each agent's performance and allow them to take on roles based on demonstrated strengths. Finally, a meta-evaluator will analyze the critiques and original responses to determine the best final output, enhancing collaboration and adaptability.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initialize Agents:** Create domain-specific agents that can generate answers and also critique others' responses.\n2. **Role Assignment Mechanism:** Implement a dynamic mechanism that evaluates the performance of agents and assigns them roles (responder or critic) based on their strengths.\n3. **Answer Generation:** Each agent generates an answer to the task at hand.\n4. **Peer Critique Process:** After generating their answers, agents critique each other's responses, focusing on clarity, relevance, and depth.\n5. **Meta-Evaluator Integration:** A dedicated meta-agent will collect and analyze responses and critiques to score each based on quality metrics.\n6. **Return the Best Answer:** The architecture will ensure that the highest-scoring response is returned as the final answer.",
