This architecture emphasizes not only collaborative reasoning but also ensures that emotional components are interwoven throughout the entire structure. It allows for multiple iterations of feedback, wherein agents adapt their responses not just based on correctness but also emotional appropriateness, creating a richer and more nuanced answer.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture consists of an **Emotion Detection Agent** to assess the user's emotional state, several **Collaborative Reasoning Agents** that generate answers while reflecting on emotional context, and a **Feedback Integration Agent** to help refine these answers based on peer reviews. This architecture will facilitate continuous interaction, allowing agents to adjust their responses based on real-time evaluations, thus ensuring the final answer is not only correct but also emotionally aligned with the user's expectations.",
