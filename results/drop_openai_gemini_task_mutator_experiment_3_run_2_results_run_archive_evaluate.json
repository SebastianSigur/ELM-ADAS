This will not only enhance the relevance of the answers but also foster critical thinking and engagement. \n**Implementation:**\n1. **User Insight Integration:** Include prompts that encourage users to reflect on current issues related to the text themes. \n2. **Tailored Feedback Instructions:** Develop specific instructions for the agents to critique each other's responses based on the context of the text and the user's insights. \n3. **Dynamic Response Refinement:** Allow agents to immediately refine their answers based on critiques relevant to their responses without waiting for a final decision agent to synthesize feedback.",
