This design will not only provide answers with confidence scores but also allow agents to reevaluate their responses based on peer feedback, leading to a more dynamic and self-correcting agent interaction. The architecture will include a reflection phase where agents assess their previous answers based on new insights received from other agents. \n**Overall Idea:** The architecture will consist of several reasoning agents that generate answers and confidence scores, followed by a reflection phase where agents can adjust their answers based on feedback from a feedback agent that evaluates the responses collectively. This promotes not just aggregation but also a learning mechanism within the system. \n**Implementation:** 1. Create a set of reasoning agents that produce answers and confidence scores. 2. Implement a feedback agent to evaluate the collective responses and provide insights back to the reasoning agents. 3. Design a reflection phase where agents can reconsider their answers based on peer evaluations. 4. Aggregate answers post-reflection to yield a final output based on adjusted confidence levels.",
