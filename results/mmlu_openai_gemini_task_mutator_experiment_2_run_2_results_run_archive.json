This architecture will replace rigid numeric scoring with a more nuanced approach to gathering feedback and suggestions. The goal is to blend qualitative feedback with quantitative scores to enrich the overall evaluation process. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe agents will provide initial insights, and during the critique phase, they will assess each other's answers. Agents will score the critiques based on predefined criteria, but they will also provide qualitative justifications for these scores. This dual approach aims to prioritize valuable suggestions while fostering a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each response.
