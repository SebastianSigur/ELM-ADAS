        "thought": "**Insights:**\nIn light of the previous architecture's similarities to existing models, I propose a revised architecture that emphasizes specialized roles in both response generation and critique without simply switching roles. Instead, agents will specialize in generating answers and provide structured feedback to others based on clear criteria. This approach will focus on the quality of insights and the integration of diverse perspectives, fostering richer outputs while maintaining clear distinctions in agent roles.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of three specialized agents (STEM, Humanities, and Social Sciences) that produce independent answers. Each agent will also have a dedicated evaluator role, enabling them to provide targeted feedback on specific aspects of their peers' responses, such as clarity, relevance, and depth. The final output will be a synthesis of the best responses, taking into account the quality of critiques received. This structured approach enhances collaboration without compromising the integrity of individual contributions.",
