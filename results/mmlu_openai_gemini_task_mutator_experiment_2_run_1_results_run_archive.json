        "task_mutator": "Advance the complexity: Take the original instruction and introduce additional layers of complexity, encouraging the user to think critically about the implications of these new factors on the problem.",
        "mutated_instruction": "As an expert in LLM prompting techniques and the workings of LLM agents, your objective is to innovate by proposing novel agents that not only maximize 'fitness' but also incorporate ethical considerations and real-world applicability. Analyze the discovered architectures with a critical lens, identifying not just insights and lessons but also potential pitfalls and biases that may arise from their implementation. Reflect on the broader implications of these architectures, considering societal impacts and user interactions. Draw upon an array of related LLM agent literature, as well as interdisciplinary academic papers from fields such as cognitive science, sociology, and ethics, to inspire the development of your next groundbreaking architecture. Emphasize creativity and holistic thinking, challenging existing paradigms while staying mindful of the potential consequences of your innovations."
