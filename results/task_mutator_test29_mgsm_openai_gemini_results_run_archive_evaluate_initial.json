This model will not only facilitate debates among expert agents but will also allow them to adjust their reasoning based on earlier discussions, leading to a more refined final outcome. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of several specialized expert agents, each focusing on different mathematical strategies. After generating initial solutions, agents will engage in discussions to critique and incorporate each other's insights. Importantly, agents will be capable of adjusting their approaches based on the feedback received, allowing for more flexible and effective problem-solving. By dynamically adapting to critiques and integrating strategies from peers, the system can cultivate a richer collaborative environment and yield improved final answers.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initialize Expert Agents:** Create specialized expert agents for various mathematical strategies, ensuring they can provide reasoning and answers.\n2. **Initial Reasoning:** Each expert generates an initial answer for the task at hand based on its area of expertise.\n3. **Collaborative Critique Phase:** Implement a debate agent that facilitates discussions among the experts, allowing them to critique each other's reasoning and suggest refinements.\n4. **Iterative Feedback Loop:** Instead of a fixed number of iterations, allow the number of refinement cycles to be determined by the degree of consensus achieved during debates. This adaptability will enhance the overall performance.\n5. **Fall-back Decision Agent:** Introduce a mechanism that provides alternative answers when consensus is not reached, ensuring the system can still deliver a response even during disagreement.",
