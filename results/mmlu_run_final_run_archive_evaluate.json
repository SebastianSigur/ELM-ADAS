This would allow agents to learn from each other's critiques, promoting a more refined output through adaptive learning.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe Adaptive Cooperative Learning architecture will consist of agents generating initial answers, engaging in peer critique, and revising their answers. A meta-agent will assess the quality of feedback provided during the critique phase, which can then influence the weights of different agents' contributions to the final consensus answer. This meta-analysis of feedback will promote a more intelligent synthesis of information and improve overall performance.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initialization:** Create specialized agents for initial answer generation.\n2. **Initial Answer Generation:** Collect independent answers from the agents.\n3. **Peer Critique Phase:** Agents will provide critiques of one another, with a meta-agent to evaluate the quality of feedback.\n4. **Refinement Phase:** Agents revise their answers based on constructive feedback and meta-agent assessments.\n5. **Consensus Generation:** Utilize a weighted voting system informed by the meta-agent's evaluation of feedback quality.\n6. **Output:** Return the final consensus answer in an Info object.",
