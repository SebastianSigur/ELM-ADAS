This method encourages critical evaluation and prioritization among agents, fostering a more structured reasoning process.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of reasoning agents that generate initial answers. In the debate phase, each agent will critique the answers of their peers while assigning a score to each critique. The Decision-Maker Agent will utilize these scores to weigh contributions and provide a final refined answer. This approach promotes deeper engagement and enhances the quality of feedback through quantification.",
