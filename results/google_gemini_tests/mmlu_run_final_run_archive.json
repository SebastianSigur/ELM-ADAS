By diversifying the feedback mechanism to assess clarity and relevance and ensuring that critiques are meaningful, the architecture will better align with the goals of emotional engagement and contextual awareness. Additionally, integrating a more systematic approach to collecting feedback will streamline the revision process and enhance overall performance.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will introduce a feedback evaluation system that scores critiques based on their quality and relevance. The agents will be tasked not only with providing answers but also with offering detailed feedback that is systematically assessed for its constructive potential. This setup will ensure that each feedback round contributes positively to the refinement of the responses.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Implement a feedback evaluation system that scores critiques based on multiple criteria such as clarity, relevance, and emotional appropriateness.\n2. Ensure that agents can provide thorough critiques that directly influence each other's responses.\n3. Establish a fallback mechanism to use original responses when feedback cannot be effectively utilized.\n4.
