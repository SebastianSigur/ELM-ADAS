        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the collaborative reasoning among agents for multilingual math problems, I propose an architecture that not only supports feedback-based learning but also emphasizes the prioritization of critiques based on their relevance. This architecture will consist of specialized reasoning agents that generate initial responses, followed by a central synthesis agent that evaluates feedback from these agents and prioritizes actionable insights for refining responses. This approach will help improve both individual and collaborative outputs. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will utilize specialized agents (e.g., Analytical Agent, Practical Solver, Creative Thinker) to solve problems independently. After each generates an initial response, they will provide critiques focusing on the most impactful changes needed. A central synthesis agent will evaluate these critiques, prioritize the most relevant feedback, and guide each agent in refining their answers accordingly. This iterative process will promote continuous learning and improvement.",
