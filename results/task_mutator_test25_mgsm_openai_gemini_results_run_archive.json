This will create a more streamlined process and ensure that enhancements are constructive and contextually appropriate.\n\n**Overall Idea:**  The architecture, named 'Focused Collaborative Reasoning,' will involve agents that critique specific aspects of each other's responses, emphasizing clarity and depth in their collaborative dialogue.
