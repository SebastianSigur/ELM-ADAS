This architecture will focus on extracting relevant contextual information while continuously optimizing feedback based on its effectiveness and historical performance metrics. By dynamically adapting the reasoning strategies based on both context and feedback, this architecture aims to improve the overall problem-solving capabilities. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture consists of three components: a **Context Extraction Agent** for gathering contextual data, a **Feedback Evaluation Agent** that assesses the effectiveness of the feedback in real time, and a **Reasoning Agent** that utilizes both contextual insights and evaluated feedback to generate answers. This will create an adaptive framework for improved performance in complex mathematical problem-solving scenarios.",
