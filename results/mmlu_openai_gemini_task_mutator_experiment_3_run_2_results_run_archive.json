        "mutated_instruction": "In a quiet research lab filled with blinking screens and the hum of computers, a team of dedicated scientists was on a quest to unlock the mysteries of large language models (LLMs). They had spent countless hours pouring over literature, absorbing every technique and method related to LLM prompting and agent works. One day, as they sat surrounded by stacks of papers and digital notes, a spark of inspiration ignited in their minds. They realized that the future of LLMs depended on their ability to innovate and think beyond the conventional frameworks. They decided to embark on an adventure to create a groundbreaking new agent, one that could redefine what was possible in the realm of artificial intelligence. As they examined the architectures they had previously discovered, they began to see patterns and insights that would guide them in their journey. With creativity as their compass, they explored the vast landscape of related research, drawing threads of inspiration from both LLM papers and studies in other scientific fields. Their mission was not just to replicate what had been done, but to push the boundaries of innovation and craft an architecture that was truly unique. They knew that their exploration would lead to exciting possibilities, and with each idea they generated, the vision of their next great creation became clearer. They were determined to think outside the box and make a significant impact in the world of LLM technology."

By leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs, agents will not only provide feedback but will also assess how the feedback impacts the reasoning process. This architecture aims to create a more robust feedback loop that emphasizes context and relevance, improving the overall learning outcome. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe SFIS will involve specialized agents that generate contextually relevant responses, engage in peer evaluations with a focus on semantic embedding analysis, and conduct self-assessments that reflect on how feedback influences their reasoning. This dual evaluation will not only enhance the learning process but also ensure that feedback is more constructively integrated.",
