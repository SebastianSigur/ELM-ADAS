This agent will not only collect feedback but also evaluate the quality of that feedback over time, allowing agents to learn from one another's evaluations and improve their collective decision-making.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will focus on establishing a collaborative peer review system where agents score both their outputs and the quality of feedback received. By incorporating a mechanism for agents to adapt their contributions based on the effectiveness of their feedback, we will enhance the overall quality of the answers produced. Additionally, weighting contributions based on historical performance metrics will ensure that more reliable agents have a greater influence on the final consensus.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define specialized agents that can generate answers and provide detailed feedback.\n2. Implement a scoring system for both answers and the quality of feedback, allowing agents to evaluate their peers.\n3. Track historical performance metrics for each agent, influencing how much weight their feedback carries in future tasks.\n4. Collect and aggregate feedback effectively, ensuring only valid and high-quality contributions affect the final decision.\n5.
