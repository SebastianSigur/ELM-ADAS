        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo innovate upon the previous architecture, I propose a 'Dynamic Reasoning Adaptation' architecture. This design will emphasize not only contextual analysis but also introduce the ability for agents to adapt their reasoning styles based on ongoing peer feedback, thus enhancing the collaborative nature of problem-solving. This architecture will incorporate a structured feedback mechanism that categorizes critiques into actionable items, further promoting practical improvements in reasoning.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture consists of a 'Contextual Insight Agent' to extract and rank key contextual variables, followed by multiple 'Adaptive Reasoning Agents' that will utilize insights from the contextual analysis dynamically. A structured feedback mechanism will facilitate peer learning and ensure that agents can adapt their reasoning strategies based on effective critiques and insights into their problem-solving processes.",
