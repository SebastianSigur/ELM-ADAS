This architecture will allow agents to assess their effectiveness dynamically and shift roles or responsibilities based on their demonstrated strengths throughout the problem-solving process.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe 'Adaptive Role Assignment Agent' will consist of multiple specialized agents (math, linguistic, ethical, visual) that will continuously evaluate their performance against a set of criteria. They will collaborate on solving math problems, and based on their success rates and feedback from peers, they will reassign roles and responsibilities as needed. This mechanism promotes not only collaborative learning but also ensures that the best-suited agents are engaged according to the task requirements in real time.",
