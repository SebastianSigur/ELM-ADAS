        "thought": "**Insights:**\nIn order to enhance the effectiveness of collaborative reasoning while leveraging historical performance data, I propose a 'Dynamic Weighting Collaborative Reasoning Agent' that builds upon the original architecture but adds a more nuanced approach to how the weights are calculated and how expert contributions are aggregated. This architecture will integrate a scoring mechanism that evaluates the correctness of each expert's contributions over multiple tasks and utilizes this dynamic scoring to inform future interactions.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will maintain a detailed memory structure that tracks each expert\u2019s performance across various tasks. This will allow for a more informed approach to weighting expert contributions, dynamically adjusting the influence of each expert based on their cumulative success rate and contextual relevance to the current task. The goal is to foster a more adaptive system that can recalibrate its reliance on specific experts based on their proven track record.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Enhanced Memory Structure:** Utilize a dictionary that keeps cumulative scores for each expert based on correctness over multiple tasks, allowing for easier updates and evaluations of historical performance.\n2. **Dynamic Scoring Mechanism:** Implement a scoring function that evaluates the correctness of answers against a known set of correct answers, adjusting the weighting of each expert\u2019s responses accordingly.\n3. **Nuanced Aggregation Method:** Instead of a simple majority vote, aggregate the responses using a weighted average that reflects both the correctness of the responses and the historical performance of the experts, leading to more reliable decision-making.",
