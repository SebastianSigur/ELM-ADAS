This would provide a more iterative approach to problem-solving, essentially creating a dialogue between the expert agents and allowing them to refine their answers collaboratively.\n\n**Overall Idea:** This architecture will consist of an initial routing agent that evaluates the task, assigns appropriate experts, and begins the problem-solving process. After gathering initial answers, the architecture will include a feedback mechanism that evaluates the responses, identifies discrepancies, and allows the agents to revisit the problem collaboratively through additional queries. This dynamic interaction can lead to improved accuracy and deeper insights.\n\n**Implementation:** 1. Define a routing agent to assess the task and identify the necessary expertise required. 2. Allow multiple experts to provide responses simultaneously. 3. Implement an evaluation mechanism to determine discrepancies in answers. 4. Create a loop that allows agents to query each other based on their initial responses. 5. Return the final synthesized answer as an Info object, ensuring clarity and consistency.",
