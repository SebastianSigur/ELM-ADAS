        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo create a more dynamic interaction among agents and improve performance, I propose a revised architecture that introduces a 'Dynamic Refinement Loop.' In this architecture, agents not only provide solutions but also allow critique feedback to influence the development of their answers in a continuous cycle. This method would leverage the immediate feedback for iterative improvements, creating a more coherent and cohesive answer from multiple perspectives.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will involve two main types of agents: a Solution Agent and a Critique Agent. The Solution Agent will formulate initial answers, while the Critique Agent will provide real-time feedback on those answers. Instead of a separate final decision phase, the feedback will be integrated dynamically, allowing for adjustments to the solution as critiques are received. This will foster an environment of iterative improvement.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Develop a Solution Agent that generates answers and can accept critique input at any point in its reasoning.\n2. Create a Critique Agent that evaluates the current output of the Solution Agent and provides constructive feedback.\n3. Encourage a feedback loop where the Solution Agent can refine its answers based on the critiques received iteratively.\n4. Ensure that the integration of feedback is seamless and allows for immediate corrections and improvements.",
