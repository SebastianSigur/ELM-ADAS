This method allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of the experts' responses while minimizing redundancy in feedback processing. The approach will foster a more adaptive and effective selection process. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will implement a multi-expert collaboration framework where each expert provides an answer and critiques the others' responses. A synthesis agent will then compile these critiques along with the original answers to produce a final response that reflects a consensus among experts while dynamically scoring their contributions based on relevance and feedback. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Define multiple expert agents to contribute independent reasoning and critiques.\n2. Each expert will generate their answers based on task information and provide feedback on others' answers.\n3. Introduce a synthesis agent to evaluate the feedback and the answers, consolidating them into a final response.\n4.
