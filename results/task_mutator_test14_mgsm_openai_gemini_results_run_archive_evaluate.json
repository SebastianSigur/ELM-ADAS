This will allow the CoT agent to better contextualize its responses based on how emotional states might affect understanding.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe revised architecture will employ a more structured approach to integrate emotional insights into specific reasoning techniques. Instead of merely analyzing emotions, this agent will use emotions to shape the problem-solving pathway, encouraging more empathetic and user-focused reasoning steps.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define the EI agent to analyze the emotional context and provide specific actionable insights.\n2. Use the EI output to guide the CoT agent's initial reasoning, ensuring the emotional context is directly referenced in each reasoning step.\n3. After generating a response, let the CoT agent refine its answer more explicitly based on the emotional context provided.\n4. Return the final answer in a way that reflects both logical and emotional understanding in a coherent format.",
