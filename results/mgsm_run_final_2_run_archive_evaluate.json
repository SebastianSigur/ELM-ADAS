Instead of a singular focus on critique adaptation, the architecture will emphasize diverse reasoning perspectives by having multiple agents tackle the same problem from different mathematical angles. Each agent will generate answers independently, and their outputs will be aggregated to derive a final consensus answer. This method allows for a more comprehensive exploration of solutions and leverages the strengths of various mathematical strategies.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe proposed architecture will utilize multiple reasoning agents, each specializing in different mathematical domains (e.g., Algebra, Geometry, Statistical Analysis). After generating their respective answers, a majority voting or weighted aggregation method will be employed to determine the most accurate solution. This collaborative approach not only improves the diversity of solutions but also enhances the overall problem-solving capability by reducing individual biases.",
