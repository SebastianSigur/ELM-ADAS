This architecture aims to dynamically adjust the knowledge retrieved based on task complexity and incorporate a structured feedback mechanism to improve subsequent reasoning steps.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture consists of a `DynamicKnowledgeRetrievalAgent` that adjusts the retrieval strategy based on the complexity of the task. This agent will also gather contextual knowledge that relates directly to the mathematical problem. The `ContextualReasoningAgent` will then synthesize this knowledge while incorporating a feedback mechanism that helps refine the solution iteratively, leading to improved accuracy and contextually relevant outputs.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create a `DynamicKnowledgeRetrievalAgent` that uses keywords and task complexity to query a knowledge database or generate examples.\n2. Develop a `FeedbackLoopAgent` that reviews the initial output and suggests improvements based on the reasoning context.\n3. Tie the feedback loop intricately into the reasoning process to ensure that the model learns from past mistakes and adjusts its approach accordingly.",
