        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo address the shortcomings of the previous architecture while maintaining a focus on collaborative learning, I propose an architecture that emphasizes a structured approach to feedback and iterative refinement. This design will not only have specialized agents generate solutions but will also involve a systematic way for them to incorporate feedback based on specific criteria, leading to a more effective learning outcome.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of specialized agents that focus on distinct mathematical domains, each generating initial solutions. A central critique agent provides structured feedback, which each specialized agent will use to refine their responses. This process will be iterative, allowing agents to respond not only to their critiques but also to the critiques of their peers, fostering a collaborative learning environment.",
