Each agent will not only provide their initial thoughts but also engage in structured critiques that target distinct aspects of the answers (logic, clarity, depth). This structured approach will lead to a more thorough evaluation and refinement of responses, ultimately yielding a more accurate final answer. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of specialized agents assigned roles such as Logic Evaluator, Clarity Specialist, and Depth Analyst. Each agent will evaluate their peers based on their strengths, leading to a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the problem. The decision agent will synthesize these insights to produce a final answer. \n**Implementation:**\n1. **Define Roles:** Each agent will be assigned a specific evaluation criteria (Logic Evaluator, Clarity Specialist, Depth Analyst).\n2. **Initial Reasoning:** Each agent generates their initial thoughts and answers based on the task provided.\n3. **Structured Feedback:** Each agent critiques peers based on the assigned criteria, ensuring focused and valuable feedback.\n4. **Final Evaluation:** A decision agent will synthesize the initial answers and feedback to produce a coherent final answer.",
