However, it can be enhanced by introducing additional complexity through role diversification and dynamic feedback mechanisms. By incorporating a 'Critic' role, which can challenge the Mathematician's reasoning and provide alternative perspectives, we can create a richer dialogue that not only critiques but also enhances the quality of the answers. Similarly, integrating a 'Moderator' role can help facilitate the discussion, ensuring that each agent's input is balanced and guiding the conversation towards clarity and focus.\nAdditionally, incorporating multi-round questioning with a structured feedback loop can foster deeper exploration of the problem. Each agent will not only generate answers and questions but will also reflect on previous interactions to refine their contributions iteratively. This will create a highly interactive and robust solution process, encouraging agents to learn from one another and arrive at a more comprehensive understanding.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of five roles: a 'Mathematician' who provides solutions, a 'Curious Student' who asks clarifying questions, a 'Reflective Teacher' who synthesizes insights and evaluates contributions, a 'Critic' who challenges assumptions and offers alternative views, and a 'Moderator' who facilitates the interaction and ensures that all perspectives are considered. These roles will engage in iterative cycles, generating responses, questioning each other, and refining their outputs collaboratively.",

First, I will ensure that the agents follow a clearer flow in how they interact with each other and the inputs they receive. By consolidating the inputs passed to the agents, I can reduce redundancy.

Additionally, I will ensure that the content from the memory agent is correctly utilized without needing unnecessary extraction of the first element from the output. This will make the interactions cleaner and more efficient. Furthermore, I\u2019ll implement checks to ensure that the content provided by the memory agent is used properly.
