By allowing users to formulate questions about the narrative based on character insights, the architecture aims to deepen comprehension and enhance narrative exploration. The interplay of user-generated questions and agent responses will lead to a richer understanding of the text.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will first prompt users to create critical questions that explore the themes and motivations within the narrative. Then, the system will generate thoughtful responses based on these questions while also collecting feedback on the questions for clarity and relevance. This will drive the final synthesis of user inquiries and agent insights into a comprehensive output that reflects both narrative depth and user engagement.",
