This architecture will involve a single feedback mechanism that is updated based on the correctness of the response, reducing redundancy while maintaining the essence of iterative refinement.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nBy using a single feedback loop that evaluates the correctness of the output in real-time and adjusts the agent's responses accordingly, the architecture can optimize resource use while maintaining accuracy. This will entail fewer API calls without sacrificing the iterative process, thus enhancing efficiency.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize the main instructions for generating an answer and for providing feedback.\n2. Use only one instance of LLMAgentBase for generating answers and feedback.\n3. In the iterative loop, check the correctness and generate additional iterations based on the previous outputs and the correctness feedback to refine the answer iteratively.\n4. Return the most refined answer after the specified number of iterations or when confidence reaches a certain threshold.",
