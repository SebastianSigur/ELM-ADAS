This approach allows us to dynamically adjust the paths based on initial feedback from various agents, leading to a stronger final consensus.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of multiple agents generating reasoning paths independently while iteratively refining their answers based on the feedback from one another. This enables the model to consider and weigh various solutions before converging on a final answer. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize multiple agents to explore different reasoning paths, each focused on specific aspects of the problem.\n2. Each agent will generate initial thoughts and potential answers.\n3. Use a feedback mechanism where all agents provide critiques of one chosen answer, leading to a refined output based on collective input.\n4. Incorporate a final decision agent that synthesizes the refined outputs to produce the final answer, ensuring the total number of API calls remains within the limit.",
