This will allow for a more robust solution by generating distinct outputs that can be evaluated collectively, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation process. Additionally, incorporating an iterative refinement loop will enable the selection of the best outputs based on rigorous evaluation.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will extract key mathematical principles first, utilize multiple distinct reasoning agents concurrently, and evaluate their outputs in a structured feedback loop to refine the final answer.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Extract relevant mathematical principles from the task.\n2. Utilize multiple reasoning agents to generate distinct outputs based on various interpretations of the principles.\n3. Evaluate all responses collectively to select the best answers based on clarity and correctness.\n4. Implement an iterative refinement loop to improve the final output based on evaluation feedback.",
