        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo improve the efficiency of the model while maintaining the iterative refinement approach, I propose an architecture that utilizes shared feedback for all application agents rather than having each agent independently critique one another. This will reduce the total number of API calls while still allowing for collaborative learning from diverse perspectives.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will have a principle extraction phase followed by a collective application phase where multiple agents propose solutions based on the defined principles. A single feedback agent will evaluate and enhance the proposed solutions based on critiques, which will allow for a more efficient refinement process.",
