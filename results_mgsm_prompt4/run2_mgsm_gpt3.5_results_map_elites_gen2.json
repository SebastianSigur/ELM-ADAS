The focus will be on providing a variety of reasoning paths to enrich the solution space and increase the likelihood of finding the correct answer.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will use a single LLMAgentBase instance to generate three distinct answers based on different reasoning strategies. It will then proceed to evaluate these answers using a quantifiable method to determine the most accurate solution, achieving a balance between diversity and efficiency.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create a single LLMAgentBase instance that generates multiple answers based on different reasoning paths.\n2. Incorporate an evaluation mechanism that scores each answer based on its correctness and clarity, allowing for effective selection of the final answer.",
