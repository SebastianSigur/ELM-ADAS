By enabling agents to not only refine their answers based on aggregated feedback but also to understand and discuss each other's outputs, we can create a more robust reasoning environment.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will consist of an analysis phase followed by several collaborative solution agents that generate answers and exchange feedback with each other. After this feedback loop, the decision agent will evaluate the refined answers. This will ensure a more dynamic and comprehensive exploration of the problem space.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create an analysis agent to extract principles from the math problem.\n2. Use multiple solution-generating agents that work in parallel.\n3. After generating initial answers, introduce a collaborative phase where agents review and discuss one another\u2019s outputs before refining their solutions.\n4.
