        "thought": "To refine the proposal, I will focus on creating a single critique phase instead of multiple debate agents. This will reduce the API call count while still allowing for effective evaluation of generated answers. The architecture will consist of a single agent that critiques the generated answers and provides a unified feedback output. After reflecting on the generated answers, the model will select the best response based on this critique. This will maintain diversity in solutions while optimizing API usage.\n\nThe new structure will include:\n1. Generate multiple diverse answers using several Chain-of-Thought agents.\n2. Use a single critique agent to evaluate the generated answers and provide feedback.\n3. A final decision-making agent that takes the critiques into account to select the best answer.",
