Instead of treating the analysis of components in isolation, we will explicitly tie back the analysis to the principles identified earlier. This will create a cohesive reasoning flow and emphasize how each component relates to the overall problem. Additionally, by structuring the analysis phase to always refer back to the principles, we can enhance the clarity and depth of the solution.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will maintain the multi-step reasoning approach while ensuring that every component's analysis explicitly incorporates the principles identified. This will enhance the overall coherence and clarity of the reasoning process, leading to better performance.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Extract the relevant principles as before.\n2. Decompose the task into components based on these principles.\n3. For the analysis, collect all components and analyze them in one call, ensuring that the analysis directly references the identified principles.\n4. Aggregate refined answers while ensuring that the explanation of how principles relate to the components is clear and integrated.",
