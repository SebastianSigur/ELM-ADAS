This variation in the problem-solving approach can lead to richer output and ensure a higher likelihood of correctness through diversity.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will request three distinct perspectives on the same task within a single API call. By structuring the prompt to encourage varied reasoning strategies, we can obtain a more comprehensive set of answers.
