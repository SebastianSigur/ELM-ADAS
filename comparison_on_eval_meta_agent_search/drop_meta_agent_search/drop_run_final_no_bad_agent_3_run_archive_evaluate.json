By allowing agents to share insights and constructively discuss their findings, we can create a more nuanced understanding of the passage. This architecture will leverage the strengths of each agent\u2019s perspective, promoting a richer dialogue that ultimately results in a more coherent and comprehensive final answer.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of multiple specialized agents (Fact Extraction, Inference, Context Understanding) that independently analyze the passage. Each agent will then present its findings in a discussion format, where agents can respond to and build upon each other's insights. A 'Final Collaborative Agent' will then synthesize these discussions into a coherent final answer that reflects the collaborative output. This method promotes a diverse array of perspectives while reinforcing the coherence of the resulting answer.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define specialized agents with clear roles and instructions. \n2. Each agent processes the task independently, providing insights based on the passage. \n3. Implement a discussion mechanism where agents share findings and respond to one another. \n4. Use a collaborative synthesis agent to gather the insights and produce a final answer.",
