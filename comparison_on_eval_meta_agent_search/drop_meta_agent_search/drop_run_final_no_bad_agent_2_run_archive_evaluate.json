        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe focus of the new architecture will be on dynamically assessing knowledge relevance and impact, but with an emphasis on adaptive integration strategies. Instead of just weighing knowledge, we will focus on creating a more contextual integration that allows the agent to leverage knowledge based on its immediate relevance to the task rather than a cumulative impact score. This will involve a more refined assessment of knowledge sources based on their contextual fit into the task at hand.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will implement a `Contextual Adaptive Knowledge Integration Agent` that evaluates multiple knowledge pieces based on a scoring mechanism that captures both relevance and contextual importance. The integration will be dynamic, prioritizing knowledge that fits the current task rather than relying on fixed scoring thresholds. \n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Query Knowledge Sources:** Gather relevant knowledge sources based on the task context.\n2. **Assess Contextual Relevance:** Evaluate each piece of knowledge based on immediate contextual relevance instead of cumulative scores.\n3. **Dynamic Integration:** Integrate only the most relevant knowledge with task information in a streamlined manner, avoiding redundant steps.\n4. **Final Reasoning:** Use the integrated knowledge alongside task information to derive the final answer.",
