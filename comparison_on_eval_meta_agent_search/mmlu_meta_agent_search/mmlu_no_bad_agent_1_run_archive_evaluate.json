        "thought": "**Insights:**\nBy enhancing the previous 'Structured Debate' architecture, we can create a more collaborative and nuanced process where critique agents not only critique responses but also provide alternatives and enhance the quality of the initial response by integrating various perspectives. This could lead to a better overall synthesis of answers.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe revised architecture will maintain the core debate structure but will introduce a method for critique aggregation to ensure that the refinement process benefits from a more holistic view of feedback. This change aims to improve the final output quality by using diverse insights from critique agents.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Begin with an initial reasoning agent to generate a response to the task.\n2. Implement multiple critique agents that will provide critiques and alternative responses.\n3. Aggregate critiques from all critique agents to create a comprehensive feedback set.\n4. Allow the original reasoning agent to refine its answer based on the aggregated feedback.\n5. Use a synthesis agent to compile the refined answers into a coherent final response.",
