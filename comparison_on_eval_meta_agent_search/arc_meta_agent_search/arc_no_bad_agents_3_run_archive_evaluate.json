        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the architecture's capability further, I propose a system that incorporates collaborative generation and feedback analysis. This architecture will consist of multi-functional agents that generate diverse transformation codes and collectively analyze their performance, integrating insights to refine their proposed solutions dynamically. This approach emphasizes diversity and collaboration, allowing for a richer exploration of potential solutions. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe proposed architecture involves several agents: a Collaborative Code Generator, a Feedback Integrator, and a Consensus Decision Maker. The idea is to have the Collaborative Code Generator produce a range of transformation codes simultaneously, while the Feedback Integrator evaluates these codes against examples, and the Consensus Decision Maker synthesizes the insights to select an optimal solution. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of collaborative intelligence and broaden the search space for potential code transformations.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Collaborative Code Generation:** Initialize multiple code generator agents that produce parallel outputs based on the input task.\n2. **Feedback Integration:** Collect feedback from all generated codes, analyzing strengths and weaknesses collectively rather than individually.\n3. **Consensus Decision Making:** Use insights from the Feedback Integrator to reach a consensus on the best transformation code.\n4. **Final Execution:** Finally, execute the selected code on the test input to derive the output grid.",
