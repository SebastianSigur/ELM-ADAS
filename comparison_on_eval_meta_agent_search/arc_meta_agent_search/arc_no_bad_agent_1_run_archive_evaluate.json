This architecture will allow agents not only to generate solutions but also to adaptively refine their strategies based on the success of past transformations, thereby creating a more robust and effective learning system.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will utilize a dynamically adjustable temperature mechanism for agents based on their performance, allowing them to explore a wider variety of solutions. It will store past transformation strategies along with their effectiveness to inform future generations. The architecture will also ensure that reasoning behind transformations is a core part of the feedback loop, which will be crucial for understanding and improving performance.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Maintain agents that generate solutions with dynamically adjusted temperatures based on feedback from prior performances.\n2. Collect and utilize memory of past successful transformations and their reasoning to influence future generation strategies.\n3. Enhance the feedback mechanism to ensure that each agent\u2019s reasoning informs the final decision on transformations.\n4. Streamline the decision-making criteria to focus on both correctness and the reasoning behind each transformation, promoting a more holistic approach to problem-solving.",
