        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo further innovate on the previous architecture, I propose a 'Dynamic Reasoning Enhancement System' that emphasizes adaptive learning through a structured feedback loop. This architecture will utilize multiple specialized reasoning agents that focus on distinct methodologies (deductive, analogical, inductive) while integrating a feedback mechanism that iteratively refines their outputs based on real-time critiques. The goal is to not only generate answers but also foster an environment where reasoning agents can learn from their own and each other's mistakes.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis design leverages a multi-agent system where specialized agents generate responses, followed by a critique phase where feedback is used to improve the agents\u2019 reasoning strategies adaptively. Instead of comparing each response against all others, each agent will receive specific critiques tailored to their approach, enhancing learning and performance.\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Specialized Reasoning Agents:** Create distinct agents for deductive, inductive, and analogical reasoning.\n2. **Feedback Loop:** After critiques are generated, each reasoning agent will receive targeted feedback to refine their approach for the next iteration.\n3. **Synthesis Phase:** Collect the refined responses and synthesize them into a final answer based on the best outputs after critiques have been applied.",
