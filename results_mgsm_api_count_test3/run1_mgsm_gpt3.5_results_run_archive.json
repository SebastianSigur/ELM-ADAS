        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe new architecture will focus on a tiered approach to reasoning. First, it will extract principles from the task, then engage in an iterative reasoning process that uses these principles. This will involve multiple API calls as the agent reflects on each layer of reasoning, ensuring that all layers are thoroughly explored before landing on a final answer. The architecture will also incorporate feedback loops to allow for dynamic reflection on the principles and reasoning.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis design will integrate three distinct phases: principle extraction, initial reasoning, and iterative refinement. Each phase will involve dedicated calls to the LLMAgentBase, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the mathematical problem while maximizing API calls for enhanced performance.",
