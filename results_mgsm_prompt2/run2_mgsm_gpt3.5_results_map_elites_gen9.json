This will create a cohesive flow of information without exceeding the API call limits.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of a single instruction that prompts the LLM to extract principles, solve the task, and critically evaluate its solution in one cohesive framework.

Create an instruction that asks the LLM to think step-by-step to identify principles, solve the task, and evaluate its solution all in one go.\n2.
