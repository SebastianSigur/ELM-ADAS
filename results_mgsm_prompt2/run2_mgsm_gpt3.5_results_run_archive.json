This will streamline the process and ensure clarity in the output while maximizing the use of the API effectively.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will focus on generating different approaches to solving the task in a single call while incorporating a self-reflection mechanism to evaluate the correctness of each response. This allows us to gather diverse outputs without exceeding API call limits and ensuring comprehensive evaluation based on the outputs generated.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define an instruction that prompts the LLM to generate multiple different approaches to the same problem, along with a critique of each solution.\n2. Use a single instance of LLMAgentBase to handle this instruction and return a structured response that includes the generated solutions and their evaluations.\n3. Ensure the output is well-structured, allowing for easy aggregation and decision-making based on the evaluations provided by the model.",
