        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo ensure compliance with the API call limit while still utilizing a critique mechanism, I propose a modified architecture that uses a single critic agent to evaluate the initial answer and provides feedback in a structured manner. This will allow for self-reflection without the overhead of multiple critics, thereby adhering to the API call constraints. By focusing on a single critique, we can simplify the feedback process and maintain clarity in reasoning.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will generate an initial answer and then utilize a single critic agent to review the answer, providing structured feedback that will guide the refinement process. This maintains the iterative self-reflection while ensuring the execution adheres to the API call limits.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Generate the initial answer using a Chain-of-Thought approach.\n2. Use a single critic agent to provide detailed feedback on the initial answer.\n3. Reflect on the feedback and refine the answer based on the critique, ensuring the process is coherent and direct without multiple critiques cluttering the feedback process.",
