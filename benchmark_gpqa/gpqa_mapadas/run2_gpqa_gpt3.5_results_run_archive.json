        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe existing architecture leverages multiple agents effectively but lacks an iterative feedback mechanism, which can enhance the robustness of the answers derived. Integrating a feedback loop can allow agents to refine their proposed solutions based on insights from one another, thus improving overall accuracy.\n**Overall Idea:**\nBy allowing each agent to review and refine their answers based on the outputs of the other agents in a structured manner, we can create a more collaborative decision-making process that leads to higher quality results. Each agent will have the opportunity to iterate on its answer based on the group\u2019s input, culminating in a final consensus derived from the refined outputs.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize the domain-specific agents. \n2. Each agent analyzes the task and produces initial outputs independently.\n3. Gather all the outputs from the agents and allow a single final decision agent to synthesize them into a comprehensive final answer.",
