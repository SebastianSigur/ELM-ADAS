This approach will enhance the depth of reasoning and ensure a richer aggregation of insights. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of distinct agents for Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Each agent will generate multiple insights through iterative calls before a final aggregation, leveraging a more extensive pool of information for decision-making. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Instantiate separate LLM agents for Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.\n2. Each agent will perform several analyses based on its expertise, generating multiple insights through iterative calls.\n3.
