This iterative process will encourage deeper engagement with the principles applied during problem-solving and refine the answer based on self-assessment. By structuring the instruction to prompt for reflection and refinement based on the principles identified, I aim to create a more dynamic reasoning environment.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will combine principle extraction and iterative self-reflection into a single API call, maximizing the agent's reasoning capabilities while remaining compliant with API call limits. The architecture will utilize a single LLMAgentBase instance that guides the agent through the extraction of principles, initial problem-solving, and subsequent reflection on the solution.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Develop a comprehensive instruction that prompts the agent to first identify relevant principles and then apply them to derive an initial answer.\n2. Integrate a reflection component in the instruction, prompting the agent to evaluate its solution against the principles it has articulated and refine its answer if necessary.\n3. Ensure the output is logically structured to facilitate follow-up reasoning and comprehension.",
