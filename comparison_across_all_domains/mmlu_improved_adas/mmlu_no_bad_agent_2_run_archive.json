        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe previous architecture, while valuable, lacked a clear mechanism for integrating external knowledge validation into the collaborative process. To address this, I propose a 'Knowledge Validation and Collaborative Refinement Agent'. This architecture will not only allow agents to critique each other's responses but will also incorporate an additional validation phase where answers are checked against a knowledge base before the refinement process. This ensures discussions are factual and grounded.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of an initial answer generation phase, a knowledge validation phase where answers are checked for accuracy, followed by a collaborative refinement phase where agents discuss and improve their answers based on both their critiques and the validation results.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initial Answer Generation:** Each agent generates an independent answer to the provided task.\n2. **Knowledge Validation:** Use a knowledge retrieval agent to evaluate the generated answers against a pre-defined knowledge base to validate their accuracy.\n3. **Collaborative Refinement:** Based on the validation results, agents will collectively refine their answers by discussing the implications of the knowledge validation.\n4. **Final Consensus:** The refined answers will be selected based on majority voting to ensure the best answer is chosen.",
