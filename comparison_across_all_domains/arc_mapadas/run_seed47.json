This will lead to a more robust and innovative problem-solving approach.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will clearly separate concerns by dedicating agents to different tasks: one agent will extract principles, while one consolidated agent will generate multiple transformation functions based on those principles. This will promote a more comprehensive exploration of potential solutions and ensure higher accuracy in the final output.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create a dedicated agent for extracting high-level transformation principles from the examples (1 call).\n2. Instantiate a single agent that generates multiple transformation functions based on the extracted principles (1 call).\n3. Validate each generated function against the examples (3 calls, one for each function). This results in a total of 5 API calls, fitting within the requirements for many API calls while ensuring a diverse exploration of transformation functions.",
