This architecture will allow agents to learn from the critiques, creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of generation agents that produce initial answers, followed by review agents that provide critiques and alternative suggestions. Instead of merely voting on the best answer, agents will adapt their responses based on the accumulated feedback and critiques, allowing for a more dynamic interaction and fostering an environment of continuous learning.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize multiple generation agents that produce initial answers based on the task.\n2. Set up multiple review agents that critique the answers and propose alternative solutions.\n3. Implement a feedback loop where critique suggestions are revisited by the generation agents for improvement.\n4. Return the refined answers based on iterative feedback, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the output.",

By integrating a more structured feedback mechanism, we can improve the overall efficiency of learning from critiques and promoting robust answers.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe system will consist of generation agents producing initial answers, a self-evaluation component assessing the clarity of these answers, and review agents providing critiques. This combination will allow for a more nuanced interaction where both peer feedback and self-assessments are utilized to enhance the quality of responses iteratively.
