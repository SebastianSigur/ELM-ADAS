        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the collaborative nature of the agent, I propose the 'Weighted Collaborative Insight Agent' architecture that builds on the idea of voting while introducing a more robust mechanism for evaluating the relevance and effectiveness of insights. This architecture will implement user feedback to determine the weight of insights gathered from various expert agents, leading to a more nuanced and effective decision-making process.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe agent will gather insights from specialized agents based on user-defined areas of expertise and will effectively weight these insights based on user interactions, thus prioritizing more relevant contributions. User responses will influence the voting mechanism to ensure that the decision-making process is reflective of user needs and preferences.\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Memory Structure:** Establish a persistent structure to store user interactions and the effectiveness of responses.\n2. **Filter Input:** Implement a filtering mechanism to validate user input before querying expert agents, ensuring that only relevant topics are considered.\n3. **Weighted Voting:** Introduce a voting system that adjusts the importance of each insight based on user feedback, providing a more representative final response.\n4. **Error Handling:** Include checks to ensure that valid insights are gathered before making a final decision.",
