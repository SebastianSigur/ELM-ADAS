        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe previous architecture utilized multiple agents to explore different reasoning paths. While this is innovative in its branching structure, it did not sufficiently differentiate its decision-making process from past approaches. I propose to consolidate this by implementing a scoring system that evaluates the outputs based on correctness before making a final selection. This would optimize the decision-making process.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new design will include an evaluation of each agent's output against the examples, allowing the final decision agent to select the optimal solution based on a scoring mechanism. This way, we can enforce that the final selected output is the most reliable, enhancing confidence in the results.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize three distinct LLMAgentBase agents to explore diverse transformation strategies independently.\n2. Each agent will generate a transformation code based on the provided input.\n3. Implement a scoring mechanism that evaluates each agent's output against the examples, counting how many transformations are correct.\n4. Use a single final decision agent to select the transformation with the highest score, ensuring that the best solution is chosen for the input test case.\n5. Maintain the architecture within the required API call limit while ensuring effective outputs.",
