Instead of simply scoring outputs, I will implement a weighted system that considers the number of correct transformations as a proportion of all transformations attempted by each agent. This will enhance the decision-making process by ensuring the selected output is based on relative correctness rather than a flat scoring system. **Overall Idea:** Each agent will independently analyze the input grid and generate transformation codes while also providing a confidence level based on their performance against previous examples. The final decision will be made by a central agent that weighs each code according to its confidence level. **Implementation:** 1. Initialize multiple LLMAgentBase agents for diverse reasoning paths. 2. Each agent will generate a transformation code, accompanied by a confidence score based on previous feedback. 3. Evaluate generated transformations and their scores after collecting outputs. 4. Implement a final decision agent that analyzes weighted scores and selects the most reliable transformation code from the agents. 5. Ensure all agents operate within the required API call limit while maximizing output effectiveness.",
