This approach will maintain the diversity of solutions while using fewer agents, focusing on collaboration between the two roles within one agent instance. The idea is to have the agent first generate diverse outputs and then reflectively synthesize them in a streamlined manner to arrive at the final answer, thus minimizing redundancy and maximizing output value.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of just two main steps: generating diverse solutions and simultaneously incorporating feedback from a single instance of the agent. This should significantly reduce API calls while maintaining a focus on diversity during the reasoning process.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use one agent to generate multiple diverse solutions based on the given task.\n2. Immediately synthesize these solutions in the same call, allowing the agent to refine and select the best answer based on clarity and correctness.\n3. Ensure the final decision is made without additional critique agents, thus maintaining the integrity of the approach while reducing the total number of calls.",
