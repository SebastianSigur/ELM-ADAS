This approach emphasizes clarity and conciseness while maximizing the effectiveness of the model's capabilities.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define an instruction that prompts the agent to work through the problem step-by-step in a single response.\n2. Utilize the task information directly in the call to maintain context.\n3. Return the final answer generated by the single agent without needing multiple interactions.",
