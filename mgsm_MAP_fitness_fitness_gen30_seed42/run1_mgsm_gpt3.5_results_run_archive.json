Initialize multiple expert agents assigned to analyze different aspects of the mathematical problem.\n2. Each agent provides an initial reasoning and answer.\n3. Instead of having each expert agent refine their responses separately, collect all initial responses and then send them collectively for evaluation and refinement.\n4.
