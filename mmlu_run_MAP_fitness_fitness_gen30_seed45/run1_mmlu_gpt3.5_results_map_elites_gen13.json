This way, we can factor in the reasoning quality or confidence level of responses. Moreover, we can incorporate multiple rounds of feedback by enabling agents to reflect on both their previous iterations and the outputs of others, allowing for a richer refinement cycle. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will utilize multiple agents in a more dynamic way, where the feedback from previous rounds will inform not just the next prompt but will also incorporate a weighted approach to final decision-making. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Set up multiple LLMAgentBase instances with varied temperatures for enhanced response diversity.\n2. In each iteration, collect answers and rate them based on confidence or richness of reasoning.\n3. Implement a weighted voting mechanism that combines feedback from previous responses to generate a more informed prompt for the next iteration.\n4.
