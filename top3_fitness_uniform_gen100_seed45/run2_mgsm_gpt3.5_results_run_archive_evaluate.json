This design will still allow for feedback and refining while adhering to the 'few API calls' requirement.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will maintain the principle extraction phase but will utilize a single Calculation Agent that generates multiple outputs using the extracted principles. This will enhance efficiency and reduce the number of calls. A Final Decision Agent will then evaluate these outputs to select the best answer based on confidence scores.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Begin with the principle extraction phase to identify key relationships.\n2. Use a single Calculation Agent that generates multiple potential answers and confidence scores based on the principles.\n3. Introduce a Final Decision Agent to evaluate and select the best-supported answer based on the confidence scores.",
