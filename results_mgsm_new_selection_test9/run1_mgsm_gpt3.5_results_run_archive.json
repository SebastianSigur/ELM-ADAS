Additionally, this architecture will incorporate a voting mechanism where the feedback for refinement is based on multiple agents, ensuring robustness in the final answer. This layered approach captures various insights and maintains a flow that maximizes the use of multiple agents without compromising on clarity or depth of reasoning.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of two main phases: extracting high-level principles through multiple expert agents and applying these principles through a collaborative approach involving multiple agents for the solution. A voting mechanism will be employed to finalize the answer based on diverse insights from the agents in the refinement stage. This will ensure compliance with the many API calls constraint while fostering a richer reasoning process.",
