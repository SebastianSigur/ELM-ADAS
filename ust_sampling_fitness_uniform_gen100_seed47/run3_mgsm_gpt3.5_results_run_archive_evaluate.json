        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the architecture's capability, I propose a system that not only utilizes diverse roles but also incorporates an iterative refinement step to improve consistency among the generated responses. This allows each agent to not only provide initial answers but also to reflect on and revise them based on the feedback from other agents, thus enhancing the quality of the final output.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will involve generating initial answers through various specialized agents, followed by a second refinement phase where agents assess their own and each other\u2019s responses to converge on a more robust solution. This structured feedback loop will improve the semantic relevance of the answers and their coherence. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Define multiple roles for agent instances to generate diverse answers.\n2. Each agent will produce an initial answer based on its role.\n3. Implement a second round of feedback where agents reflect on the initial answers, enhancing them based on comparisons with other agents' outputs.\n4. Aggregate and return the refined response that is semantically consistent.",
