The architecture will leverage the strengths of each agent to create an enriched reasoning experience.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture consists of:\n1. An Analysis Agent to dissect the problem.\n2. A Principle Extraction Agent to identify the relevant mathematical principles.\n3. A Reasoning Agent to apply the principles to find a solution.\n4. A Validation Agent to ensure the solution's correctness and coherence.\nThis segmented approach allows for greater depth and multiple calls, aligning with the requirements for many API calls.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define four distinct agents that will be called sequentially, ensuring each agent handles a specific phase of the problem-solving process.\n2. Capture and combine their outputs to deliver a final answer.",
