This will encourage deeper reasoning and better solutions. The new architecture will consist of a routing mechanism based on expert roles and a reflective process for answer improvement.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will first determine which expert to engage based on the task's context and then generate an initial answer. After that, it will involve a feedback loop where a critique agent evaluates the initial answer and provides insights for enhancement. This reflective step aims to refine the answer iteratively, potentially leading to more accurate solutions.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Use a routing agent to determine which expert agent should solve the task based on the task description.\n2. Generate an initial answer using the selected expert agent.\n3. Implement a critique agent that provides feedback on the answer.\n4. Allow for a reflective iteration where the answer is improved based on critique feedback.\n5.
