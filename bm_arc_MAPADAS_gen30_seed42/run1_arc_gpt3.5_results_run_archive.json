By using one agent, we can continuously refine the transformation code while leveraging feedback from the previous attempts to guide the next generation of code. This structure will reduce the total API calls and maintain clarity in the implementation. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe design will incorporate a single LLMAgentBase instance to generate the transformation code iteratively, allowing for learning from feedback while keeping the number of calls to a minimum. This will ensure compliance with API call limits and provide a streamlined process for refining the transformation logic.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize a single LLMAgentBase instance to handle the task of generating transformation code.\n2. Set a maximum number of iterations to refine the code based on feedback.\n3. After generating the code in each iteration, evaluate its effectiveness using feedback from examples.\n4. Adjust the instruction to guide the agent in the next iteration based on the feedback received.\n5. Return the output based on the best transformation code found through this iterative process.",
