The updated architecture will incorporate an internal decision-making process that evaluates whether to revisit the original answer based on feedback without invoking additional API calls unnecessarily.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will use a single Chain-of-Thought agent for reasoning. After generating an answer, it will assess feedback from a critic and decide whether to refine the answer or end the process. This way, we avoid multiple agent instantiations within the feedback loop, thus ensuring compliance with API call limits and maximizing efficiency.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Initial Attempt:** Generate an answer using the Chain-of-Thought agent.\n2. **Feedback Mechanism:** Solicit feedback with a single call that checks if the answer is correct and suggests improvements.\n3. **Conditional Re-evaluation:** Decide based on feedback whether to re-evaluate the answer or conclude the process.
