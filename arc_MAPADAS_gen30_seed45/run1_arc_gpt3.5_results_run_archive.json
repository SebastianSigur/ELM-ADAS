By refining the workflow to utilize a single agent for extraction, application, and validation in a streamlined manner, we can enhance clarity while adhering to the call constraints.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will utilize one agent that simultaneously extracts transformation rules and applies them to the test input, all in a single call. It will also incorporate validation feedback within the same call, ensuring the output is correct and reducing the overall API call count.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use a single agent to analyze the provided examples, extract transformation rules, apply them to the test input, and validate the output in a cohesive manner.\n2. Ensure clear instructions guide the agent to maximize effectiveness while staying within API call limits.",
