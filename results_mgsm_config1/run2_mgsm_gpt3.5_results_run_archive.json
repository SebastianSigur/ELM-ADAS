This approach will ensure that critiques lead directly to actionable insights affecting the final answer, promoting robustness and adaptability. The instruction should emphasize both the critique process and the synthesis of insights into the final answer.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will involve a single agent that mimics the roles of multiple experts, generating different solutions and critiquing them while actively reflecting on how these critiques can enhance the final answer. This allows for a more nuanced approach and ensures minimal API usage while facilitating varied reasoning paths.",
