This architecture will use a single LLMAgentBase instance, which will include the answer and a built-in critique process. The agent will evaluate its answer based on different criteria (accuracy, clarity, completeness) within one response, thus significantly reducing API calls. This ensures compliance with the rules while maintaining an effective feedback mechanism that still promotes iterative improvement.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will involve a single call to an LLMAgentBase that generates the answer, critiques it internally, and provides suggestions for improvement based on the evaluation criteria. This will allow the agent to refine its response in a single iteration, which is both efficient and effective.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Generate the initial answer using the LLMAgentBase.\n2. Include criteria for self-evaluation within the same call so the agent can reflect on its answer immediately.\n3.
