This would retain the benefits of breaking down the problem while allowing for a more adaptive response generation based on intermediate outputs. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe revised structure will consist of multiple agents responsible for different components of the task while allowing for real-time input from previous agent outputs, creating a feedback-rich environment that improves the overall solution quality. Each agent will be tasked to handle a separate aspect of the problem, and a final synthesis agent will combine their insights while adapting based on feedback. \n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define multiple agents, each focusing on specific aspects of the task, such as principle extraction, initial answer generation, and validation.\n2. Allow each agent to send feedback to the next in the sequence, enhancing the overall context of subsequent steps.\n3. Implement a final synthesis phase to merge insights and produce a coherent answer based on the collaborative outputs of the previous agents.",
