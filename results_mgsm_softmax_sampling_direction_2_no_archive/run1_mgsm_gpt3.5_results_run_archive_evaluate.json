By structuring the reasoning path more efficiently, we can reduce the number of API calls while maintaining clarity in the responses.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe agent will maintain a decompositional approach that breaks the problem into key sub-tasks but will utilize fewer agents that can handle multiple aspects of the problem sequentially. This will ensure that we stay within the API call limits while allowing for deeper reasoning and aggregation of results.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define clear and concise sub-tasks that can be executed within a single agent call.\n2. Create one or two LLMAgentBase instances that can be utilized to handle these sub-tasks sequentially.\n3. Collect and combine the results effectively to generate the final answer.",
