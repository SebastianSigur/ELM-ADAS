This can be implemented by allowing an agent to explore multiple perspectives based on given instructions and consolidating the results into a final decision. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Create a single agent that generates multiple paths of reasoning based on the task. \n2. Use one call to collect all different responses from this agent. \n3. Integrate a final decision process that evaluates these paths and selects the best one, using a second call to an agent to confirm the final answer. \nThis minimizes API calls while maximizing reasoning diversity.",
