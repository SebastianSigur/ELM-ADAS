This agent will handle the task in a single pass, maintaining the decompositional reasoning structure but allowing for real-time correction and refinement of answers based on feedback. By combining the evaluation with the solving process, we can avoid unnecessary API calls and improve efficiency.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will utilize a single agent that performs the following steps: 1) decompose the task into sub-tasks, 2) solve each sub-task while evaluating the answers in real time, and 3) synthesize the final answer based on these evaluated solutions. This approach ensures that we adhere to the API call limits while providing a robust mechanism for feedback and adjustment.",
