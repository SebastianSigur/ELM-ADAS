To make the architecture more interesting, I will introduce a single agent that combines the responsibilities of pattern identification and transformation into one coherent flow while still maintaining clarity. This agent will analyze the input grid, identify transformation rules based on learned examples, and then construct the output grid accordingly.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will use a single agent that processes the task in a linear manner while integrating pattern recognition and transformation logic directly.

Implement a single agent that can analyze the input grid and determine the transformation rule.\n2.
