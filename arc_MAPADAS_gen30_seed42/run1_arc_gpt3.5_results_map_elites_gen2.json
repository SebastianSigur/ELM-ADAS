To make the architecture more interesting, I will introduce a single agent that combines the responsibilities of pattern identification and transformation into one coherent flow while still maintaining clarity. This agent will analyze the input grid, identify transformation rules based on learned examples, and then construct the output grid accordingly.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will use a single agent that processes the task in a linear manner while integrating pattern recognition and transformation logic directly. This will enhance the reasoning process without increasing API calls beyond the allowed limit.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Implement a single agent that can analyze the input grid and determine the transformation rule.\n2. The agent will handle both the extraction of patterns and the construction of the output grid in one go.\n3. Ensure the output is derived from a clear understanding of the transformation process, utilizing the taskInfo effectively throughout the reasoning chain.",
