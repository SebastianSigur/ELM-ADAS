        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the effectiveness of the current architecture, I propose a model that not only identifies principles but also emphasizes clear reasoning steps in a more structured manner. This would involve explicitly guiding the model through the reasoning process to ensure that each step is articulated clearly and logically sequenced in the final answer. This approach aims to improve the output's quality by requiring the model to reflect on and summarize its reasoning at each stage. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe proposed architecture will instruct the agent to identify the core principles relevant to the task, break down the reasoning into clear, delineated steps, and then summarize these steps as part of arriving at the final answer. This structured approach will enhance transparency and coherence in the reasoning process. \n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create a detailed instruction for the agent that not only includes principle identification but also specifies the need for a clear, logical breakdown of the reasoning process. \n2. Ensure that all reasoning and final answer generation occur within a single call to maintain compliance with API usage rules. \n3. Optimize the clarity of the output by structuring the reasoning steps logically.",
