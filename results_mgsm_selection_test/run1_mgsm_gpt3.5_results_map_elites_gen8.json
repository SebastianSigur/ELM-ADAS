By asking the model to first identify principles and then immediately reason through them, we can capture a deeper understanding of the task. The self-review will allow the model to evaluate its reasoning and make corrections, increasing the overall accuracy of the response.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new agent will first identify relevant principles involved in solving the task, then reason through the task based on these principles, and finally review its output for potential mistakes before providing a solution. This will be done all within a single API call to maximize efficiency.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create an instruction that asks for principles and reasoning in a step-by-step manner.\n2. Include a self-review component within the same instruction to encourage the agent to evaluate its answer before presenting it.\n3.
