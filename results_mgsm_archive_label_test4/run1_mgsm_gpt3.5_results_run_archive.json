This approach will help the agent refine its reasoning more effectively. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will utilize a single LLM agent that combines reasoning and structured feedback specifically tailored to the task at hand. It will allow for concise iteration over proposed answers while minimizing the risk of redundant API calls, focusing instead on nuanced improvements and learning from past responses. \n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define a single LLMAgentBase instance for the task.\n2. Construct the instruction to emphasize both solving the task and generating specific improvement suggestions based on identified errors.\n3. Employ a cleaner loop to manage feedback and refinements without unnecessary API calls, focusing on actionable steps only.\n4. Integrate a mechanism to track errors and guide subsequent responses effectively.",
