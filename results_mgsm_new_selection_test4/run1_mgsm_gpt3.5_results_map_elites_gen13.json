Instead of simply critiquing each other's outputs, agents will also generate alternative answers based on the critiques received, promoting a more enriched set of reasoning paths. This approach should improve overall performance while adhering to the API call regulations.\n**Overall Idea:**\nCreate a dynamic reasoning architecture where multiple agents generate a range of possible answers. These answers will be critiqued, and based on the critiques, agents will generate alternative paths or refine their solutions. This iterative process will not only enhance the diversity of thought but also ensure that multiple perspectives are considered before arriving at a final solution.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create multiple agents that independently generate answers using the same initial instruction.\n2. Each agent will provide feedback not only for other agents\u2019 outputs but will also use that feedback to generate an alternative answer.\n3.
