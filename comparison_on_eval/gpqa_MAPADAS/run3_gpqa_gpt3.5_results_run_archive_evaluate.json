Each specialized agent will have a unique prompt that guides them to focus on specific aspects of the task, followed by a collaborative review phase to aggregate insights. This approach is innovative compared to the existing architecture due to its multi-faceted exploration before convergence, which should yield a more comprehensive understanding of the task.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe proposed architecture will consist of specialized agents that focus on distinct aspects of a problem, enabling diverse exploration of the task. After this exploration, there will be a feedback loop where agents evaluate and refine their insights based on the outputs of their peers. Finally, a decision-making agent will synthesize these insights into a cohesive answer. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Define multiple LLMAgentBase instances, each with a distinct focus (Biology, Chemistry, Physics).\n2. Each agent will analyze the taskInfo independently, generating multiple insights.\n3.
