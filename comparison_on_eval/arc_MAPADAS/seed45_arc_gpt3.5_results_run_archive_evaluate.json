I propose a new architecture that includes a synthesis phase to assess and weigh the outputs collectively, ensuring a more robust decision-making process.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nIn this design, each agent will analyze specific aspects (symmetry, color distribution, pattern recognition) and generate outputs. After the initial analyses, we will implement a synthesis agent to evaluate these outputs and feedback collectively. This will involve scoring each output based on the feedback received and selecting the most effective one for the final transformation of the grid.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create separate LLMAgentBase instances for symmetry, color distribution, and pattern recognition.\n2. Execute each agent and gather their outputs.\n3. Collect feedback from each output in a single call.\n4. Implement a synthesis step that selects the output with the highest score based on feedback received, ensuring a structured decision-making process.",
