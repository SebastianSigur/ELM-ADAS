This architecture will allow the model to not only critique its answers but also leverage previous iterations more effectively, promoting a cycle of continuous improvement. Additionally, it will minimize the number of API calls while maximizing the depth of self-reflection. By generating answers in a single pass and integrating feedback in a way that addresses clarity, correctness, and completeness all together, we can optimize the process.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will focus on generating an initial answer, followed by a self-critique phase where the agent evaluates its answer based on provided criteria. The feedback from this process will be used to refine the answer iteratively, ensuring a balance between depth of reasoning and efficiency of API usage.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Set up the initial reasoning instruction for the LLM to generate the first answer.\n2. Integrate a single feedback mechanism that evaluates the answer on multiple criteria while allowing the model to reflect on its previous outputs.\n3. Streamline the iterative refinement of the answer, ensuring the feedback is actionable and directed towards improvement.\n4.
