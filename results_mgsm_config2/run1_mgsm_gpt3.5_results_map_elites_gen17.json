This architecture can also be enhanced by giving the agent a directive to reason about the diversity of the solutions generated.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will combine the tasks of principles identification and solution generation while ensuring that the solutions generated are diverse and collectively evaluated in a single API call. This maximizes the effective use of resources and improves the likelihood of providing a correct answer.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Develop a combined instruction that guides the agent to identify principles and generate distinct diverse solutions simultaneously.\n2. Structure the reasoning component to ensure that the agent reflects on the uniqueness of each solution and selects the best one through this reflective process, all within one API call.\n3.
